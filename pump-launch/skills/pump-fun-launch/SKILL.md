# pump.fun Launch Playbook

## Overview

Launch right or don't launch. This skill builds the full plan.

## Pre-Launch Checklist (T-48h to T-0)

### T-48h — Foundation
- [ ] Token name + ticker finalized (5 chars max, memorable)
- [ ] Contract address reserved (launch on pump.fun ready)
- [ ] Logo: 1:1 ratio, 500x500px min, transparent background
- [ ] Website live (even a simple one-pager)
- [ ] X/Twitter account created (>7 days old at launch)
- [ ] Telegram group created and seeded with 10+ real members
- [ ] Wallet setup: dev wallet + bundle wallets (separate keypairs)

### T-24h — Pre-Heat
- [ ] Teaser posts on X (don't reveal CA yet)
- [ ] Build anticipation in relevant communities
- [ ] Line up 3-5 wallets for coordinated launch buy
- [ ] Decide: fair launch vs. bundled launch vs. InstaBond

### T-1h — Final Checks
- [ ] All socials pinned with launch announcement
- [ ] Bundle wallets funded (recommend 0.1-0.5 SOL each)
- [ ] Slippage set high enough (15-25% for launch volatility)
- [ ] RPC endpoint confirmed (Helius recommended — fast)

## Launch Timing Strategy

Best times to launch (PST):
- 🟢 **Best**: 9-11 AM | 2-4 PM | 8-10 PM
- 🟡 **OK**: 11 AM-2 PM | 6-8 PM
- 🔴 **Avoid**: 2-6 AM, Sunday mornings, major market events

## Bundle Strategy

Coordinated buys to seed the curve without rugpull signals:
- Use 5-10 wallets, each buying 0.1-0.3 SOL
- Spread over 2-5 minutes (not all in block 1)
- Each wallet buys from different SOL source
- Sell strategy: stagger over days, never dump >20% in one TX

## Graduation Path

```
0-10 SOL:    Survival phase — community building, organic traction
10-30 SOL:   Momentum phase — KOL outreach, cross-community push
30-60 SOL:   Acceleration — bigger wallet attention, CT engagement  
60-84 SOL:   Final push — all hands, community sprint
85 SOL:      GRADUATION → Raydium with $69K liquidity
```

Target graduation velocity: >5 SOL/day minimum to avoid death spiral.

## Post-Graduation

- Raydium LP is locked (85 SOL - 12 SOL fee = ~73 SOL LP)
- Now tradeable on Jupiter, Birdeye, Photon
- Next target: CoinGecko/CMC listing, CEX outreach
- LP burning for trust signal (optional but recommended)
