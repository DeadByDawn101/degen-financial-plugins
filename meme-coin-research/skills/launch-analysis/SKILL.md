# Launch Analysis — Early Stage Meme Intel

## Overview

The first 30 minutes of a meme coin launch tell you everything. This skill reads those signals.

## Launch Quality Checklist

### Pre-Launch Setup
- Socials created >48h before launch? (fake urgency = red flag)
- Website quality: real content vs. template?
- Dev wallet funded from: CEX withdrawal (trackable) vs. mixer (suspicious)
- Prior launches from same dev: successful/rugged/unknown?

### Launch Mechanics (first 10 minutes)
- Number of unique buyers in first block
- Largest single buy as % of supply
- Dev wallet buy size vs. announced allocation
- Bot activity: >5 wallets buying in same block = sniper cluster

### First Hour Momentum
```
0-5 min:   [X] buys | [X] SOL volume | MC: $[X]
5-15 min:  [X] buys | [X] SOL volume | MC: $[X]  
15-30 min: [X] buys | [X] SOL volume | MC: $[X]
30-60 min: [X] buys | [X] SOL volume | MC: $[X]
```

### Momentum Classification
- 🚀 **EXPLOSIVE** — >50 buys in first 10 min, organic spread
- 📈 **HEALTHY** — steady accumulation, no sniper dominance
- 🤖 **BOT-HEAVY** — concentrated buys, automated patterns
- 💀 **DEAD** — <10 buys in 30 min, volume dropping

## LAUNCH VERDICT
**QUALITY LAUNCH 🟢 / PROCEED WITH CAUTION 🟡 / PASS 🔴**
