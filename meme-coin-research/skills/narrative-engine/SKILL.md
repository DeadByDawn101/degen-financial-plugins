# Narrative Engine — Meme Coin Story Building

## Overview

Every meme coin needs a story that spreads. This skill writes it.

## Narrative Framework

### The 5-Word Pitch
Every great meme coin can be explained in 5 words.
Examples:
- "Real dog. Real AI. Real chain."  ← $STONEFREE
- "Doge but it actually works"
- "AI agent with its own wallet"

### Story Pillars (pick 2-3)
- **Real world asset** — actual person/animal/place behind it
- **First of its kind** — pioneer narrative in current meta
- **Underdog** — fighting the system, grassroots
- **Tech credibility** — actual code, on-chain proof, real utility
- **Community owned** — no team allocation, fair launch

### Content Calendar Template

**Day 1 (Launch):**
- Tweet 1: Introduce the concept — 1 clear hook sentence
- Tweet 2: Show proof — CA, chart, on-chain TX
- Tweet 3: Community CTA — "what do you think?"

**Days 2-7 (Build):**
- Daily: 1 project update + 1 personality/culture post + 1 engagement post
- Avoid: price predictions, "gonna pump", "ape in" language
- Win with: authenticity, real updates, community moments

**Week 2+ (Sustain):**
- Milestones: holder count, volume records, curve progress
- KOL outreach: tag relevant accounts with genuine angle
- Cross-community: find adjacent communities (anime, AI, dog, etc.)

## Tweet Templates

Hook tweet:
> "[Real thing] + [on-chain thing] = [one surprising outcome]. [CA or link]"

Proof tweet:
> "the [AI/agent/dog] did [thing] on-chain. here's the TX. [link]"

Community tweet:
> "what would you do if [relatable degen situation]? asking for [token mascot]."

Culture tweet:
> "[short observation about crypto/life/market] — [mascot name] doesn't care. she just [thing mascot does]."

## Constraints

- Never write: "gonna pump", "100x", "ape in now", "last chance"
- Always sound human — no corporate marketing language
- Tie everything back to the real thing (real dog, real person, real code)
